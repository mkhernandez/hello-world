# hello-world
just another repository
Hello everyone! My name is Mark Hernandez and I have a passion for technology and food in general. I would love to travel more but I am learning how to develop websites using html, css, javascript, jquery, nodejs, express, mongodb, RESTful routes and I'm probably leaving someone out but I will thank you later when I gain employment as a developer or software engineer. Did I mention food? I love food!
